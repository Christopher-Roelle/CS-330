# CS-330-H7034
My 3D Scene Portfolio Project for CS-330 - Comp Graphic and Visualization


## How do I approach designing software?
This project has made me re-evaluate some of my techniques that I use when I write modular code.
I am still learning C++, so I was acclimating myself to the language while writing this project.
This meant that at the beginning I wrote code that wasnt very modular. By about week 4-5 of progress, I
felt far more comfortable, and was able to convert the code to use external files to make object instantiation far
more easy and concise.

With these skills in mind, it will be far easier to design more modular code in the future, as I will have it in the forefront of my thought process.

## How do I approach developing programs?
When developing software I try to focus on getting a working prototype developed first, in this case, it was just a basic triangle, then expand that to a 3D
primitive. Once the primitive works, and the data structure has been determined, I will move the code to its own file, to make the code far more modular and 
reduce the clutter of the primary source file.

With this project, I feel I developed many new skills that will aid me in the future. Aside from just the C++/OpenGL skills, I learned how GPU communication works,
along with how callback functions work, which has always been a black box for me. I also learned more efficient ways to package data and communicate with sub classes.
I feel that this new information will be invaluable in my toolkit moving forward.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
As stated above, I learned many skills that will aid me in my goals.
Having these new skills and perspectives on how I write my code will aid in almost all future development tasks I may undertake.
I am far more comfortable with C++, have built a strong foundation in how Computer Graphics actually work, and how data can be sent to the GPU, which can be invaluable
in today's age, where GPUs are used for far more than just graphics calculations, but complex Scientific Simulations and Mining.

These skills will aid me in any future endeavors I may have to write code for.
